    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Ground turkey, rice, sweet potatoes, and broccoli mixed together and
      served with a side of chimichurri sauce to go over the top. These
      Chimichurri Rice Bowls are incredibly flavorful and a breeze to meal prep.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <label><strong>For the main dish</strong></label>
    <ul>
      <li>2 lbs (908 g) ground turkey (93/7)</li>
      <li>1 lb (454 g) frozen broccoli</li>
      <li>2 cups (300 g) cooked rice</li>
      <li>2 medium (500 g) sweet potatoes</li>
      <li>1 tbsp (15 g) olive oil</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>For the Chimichurri Sauce</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>¼ cup (25 g) parsley chopped</li>
      <li>¼ cup (25 g) cilantro chopped</li>
      <li>¼ cup (60 ml) red wine vinegar</li>
      <li>3 tbsp (45 g) olive oil</li>
      <li>3 cloves (15 g) garlic</li>
      <li>2 tbsp (15 g) shallot minced</li>
      <li>1 tbsp (3 g) oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <p>Rice</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook enough rice to yield 2 cups of cooked rice. 1 cup of dry rice will
        make between 2-3 cups of cooked rice depending on what kind you use.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Potatoes, Broccoli and Turkey</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Wash and cut your potatoes into a large dice. If your broccoli is in
        large florets, cut it as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        I used an air fryer to cook these. Set your air fryer to the air fry
        setting at 400°F. Add the potatoes and spray lightly with oil. Shake
        every few minutes. Once the potatoes have finished, remove and add the
        broccoli and cook for 8 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>If you don't have an air fryer, preheat your oven to 425°F.</li>
      <li>
        Toss the potatoes in a bit of oil and spread on a sheet pan. Season
        lightly with salt and pepper. Roast for 10 minutes and then flip.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you remove the tray to flip the potatoes, add the broccoli and cook
        an additional 8-10 minutes. If your broccoli has lots of ice on the
        outside, you may want to use a separate sheet pan so the water that
        melts off doesn't soak the potatoes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a bit of oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the
        turkey and brown. Cook off any water that remains in the pan. Season
        lightly with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the rice, broccoli, potatoes, and turkey have all cooked. Mix them
        all together in a giant bowl/pan. Season to taste.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Chimichurri</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Wash your parsley and cilantro. Dry with paper towels and cut of the
        stems. You don't need to pick off all of the leaves, just cut off the
        stem under the leaves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roughly chop the leaves until you have 25 grams (¼ cup) worth of each.
      </li>
      <li>
        Peel the garlic and mince the onion until you have 15 grams (2 tbsp)
        worth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place all of the ingredients into a blender or food processor and blend
        until it is homogenous and all of the ingredients are broken down.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Plating</p>
    <ol>
      Divide the chimichurri evenly 5 ways. Store in a smaller separate
      container to place within your meal prep container. You could just mix in
      the chimichurri with the food but I find it better to keep on the side.
      This recipe makes 5 servings. Divide the meat mixture evenly 5 ways
      between all of your containers.
