      <li>1 tsp (4 g) garlic powder 15 (50 g)</li>
      <li>dill pickle chips optional</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>¼ cup (25 g) shredded cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>For the potatoes</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>4 medium (750 g) russet potatoes</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp (15 g) olive oil</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>For the Mac Sauce</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>⅓ cup (75 g) plain non fat Greek yogurt</li>
      <li>2 tbsp (28 g) mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1 tbsp (12 g) ketchup</li>
      <li>1 tbsp (15 g) sweet relish</li>
      <li>½ tsp (2 g) vinegar</li>
      <li>½ tsp (2 g) onion powder</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <p>Potatoes</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 450°F.</li>
      <li>
        Wash each of your potatoes thoroughly. Cut them into a medium sized
        dice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the potatoes to a large bowl and drizzle 1 Tbsp of olive oil over
        the potatoes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to your liking. Toss the
        potatoes to coat and spread onto a sheet pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast for 10-12 minutes and then toss them around and cook an additional
        10-12 minutes or until desired doneness is achieved.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Beef</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut your onion into a small dice.</li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add 2 tsp of oil and your
        diced onion. Cook the onion until it has developed a good amount of
        browning. We want to bring out the natural sweetness so take it past the
        point where it is translucent and it has a deep brown color. Adding a
        bit of water can help speed up this process.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the onion has browned, make room in the center of your skillet and
        add your ground beef. Use a bit more oil if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the beef until it has browned and season with salt and pepper to
        taste.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Cabbage</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tsp of oil over medium heat. Add in the cabbage, 1 tsp garlic
        powder, and salt to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook for about 3-4 minutes. You can add a bit of water to create steam
        and help it cook faster.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Mac Sauce</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add all of the ingredients to a bowl and stir to mix. Divide the sauce
        into small., separate containers to store.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Plating</p>
    <ol>
      This recipe makes 5 servings. Divide your hamburger, potatoes, and cabbage
      evenly between your 5 containers. Top the hamburger with a bit of shredded
      cheese and a few pickle chips. Each container gets 1 ramekin of the mac
      sauce.
    </ol>
